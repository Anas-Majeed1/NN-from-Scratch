# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch with NumPy

This project demonstrates the step-by-step design of a neural network from scratch using NumPy, providing detailed explanations for each step of the process. The implementation is structured to help understand the inner workings of neural networks without relying on pre-built libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Features

### 1. Designing Perceptron Using Class
- Implementation of a perceptron as a Python class.
- Detailed breakdown of its components and functionality.

### 2. Feedforward Propagation
- Explanation and implementation of feedforward propagation.
- Examples:
  - **Classification**: 5 examples to demonstrate classification tasks.
  - **Regression**: 5 examples to demonstrate regression tasks.

### 3. Backward Propagation
- Implementation of backward propagation to compute gradients.
- Examples:
  - **Classification**: 5 examples to illustrate how gradients are calculated for classification tasks.
  - **Regression**: 5 examples to show the process for regression tasks.

### 4. Gradient Descent
- Application of gradient descent for optimization.
- Examples:
  - **Using Keras**: 3 examples demonstrating how gradient descent operates when implemented in Keras for comparison.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
- Keras (optional, for gradient descent examples)

## Project Structure
- **Perceptron Class**: Defines the perceptron with methods for initialization, forward propagation, and weight updates.
- **Feedforward Propagation**: Demonstrates how inputs are passed through the network and outputs are computed.
- **Backward Propagation**: Explains how gradients are calculated and propagated back to adjust weights.
- **Gradient Descent**: Shows the optimization process using a hands-on approach and comparison with Keras.

## Example Use Cases
1. **Classification**: Binary and multiclass classification tasks.
2. **Regression**: Predicting continuous outputs.
3. **Visualization**: Graphs to visualize learning progress, loss, and accuracy (optional).

## Why This Project?
Understanding neural networks at a fundamental level is crucial for anyone aiming to work in AI/ML. This project bridges the gap between theory and implementation by breaking down complex concepts into simple, executable steps.
